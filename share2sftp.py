This script uses the requests library to download the file from SharePoint, and the paramiko library to connect to the SFTP server and upload the file. It saves the downloaded file to a local path, and then uploads it to the specified remote path on the SFTP server.

Make sure to update the values for file_url, local_path, remote_path, hostname, username, and password with your own values before running the script.
